I wrote a README the other day for a project that I'm hoping other developers will look at and learn from, and as I was writing it, I realized that it was the sort of thing that might have intimidated the hell out of me a couple of years ago, what with its casual mentions of Node, npm, Homebrew, git, tests, and development and production builds. 

Once upon a time, editing files, testing them locally (as best as we could, anyway), and then FTPing them to the server was the essential workflow of a front-end dev. We measured our mettle based on our ability to wrangle IE6 into submission or achieve pixel perfection across browsers. Many members of the community -- myself included -- lacked traditional programming experience. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- usually in the form of jQuery -- were self-taught skills.

Something has changed in the last couple of years. Maybe it's the result of people starting to take front-end dev seriously, maybe it's browser vendors mostly getting their shit together, or maybe it's front-end devs -- again, myself included -- coming to see the well-established light about things like process automation. 

Whatever it is, I think we're seeing the emphasis shift from valuing trivia to valuing tools. There's a new set of baseline skills required in order to be successful as a front-end developer, and developers who don't meet this baseline are going to start feeling more and more left behind as those who are sharing their knowledge start to assume that certain things go without saying. 

Here's my list of things that *I* want to start assuming people are familiar with, along with some resources you can use if you feel like you need to get up to speed. As with anything, though, reading about these things won't make you an expert, or even moderately skilled -- the only surefire way to get better at a thing is to [do that thing](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2011/05/20/getting-better-at-javascript/).

## Git (and a Github account)

## Modularity and dependency management

## The command line

## CSS preprocessors

## Unit and Integration Testing

## Process automation (rake/make/grunt/etc.)
