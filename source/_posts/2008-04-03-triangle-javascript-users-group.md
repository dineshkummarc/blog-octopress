My friend Matt Henry and I are going to try to get a Javascript users group started in Durham so we can meet other users (and probably do a bit of jQuery evangelizing). If you're interested, visit the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/triangle-javascript?hl=en">Triangle Javascript Users Group</a> page, and join us at the Federal in downtown Durham on May 6.
