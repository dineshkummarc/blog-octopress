When I noticed that a conference I'm attending didn't have any female speakers listed, I contacted the organizers to see what was up. As soon as I wrote them, though, I realized that I didn't even have anyone to recommend for inclusion. Thus was born Triangle Web Women, my local effort to foster connections, promote knowledge-sharing, and generally establish a community among local female web professionals.

Interested? Check out <a href="http://triwebwomen.ning.com">triwebwomen.ning.com</a>, the fledgling website where I'm gathering participants and sharing events.

Before the site was even set up, we had an initial gathering at a local restaurant, with five of us drinking wine, eating tapas, and talking about everything from accounting software to time-tracking to whether the world needs yet another content management system. I'm looking forward to our next gathering, March 19, location TBA, with a few more web-working women. We may not take over the conference circuit, but it's a start, right?
