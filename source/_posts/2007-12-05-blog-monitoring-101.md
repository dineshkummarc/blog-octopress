I've helped set up a couple of corporate blogs, and -- for corporate bloggers especially -- it can take a little bit of doing to understand your place in the great blog-o-sphere. There is lots of advice out there about how to win friends and influence people with your blog, and I don't purport to know better than everything that's already been written. However, I do have one thing to say to people venturing into the blog waters for the first time: Google is your friend.

<h3>Google Blogsearch and Google Reader</h3>

To be an active participant in the blogosphere, you need to do more than talk -- you also need to listen. These two tools together provide great insight into what people are saying about topics you care about.

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com">Google blogsearch</a> to search for terms you care about. Get the URL for the Google Blogsearch feed for each search term (in the left-hand nav of the Google blogsearch page) and add it to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>.</li>
<li>See what shows up; pay special attention to contributors who are cited by other contributors.</li>
<li>Comment (meaningfully, not gratuitously!) on posts that relate to what you blog about, and include a link back to your blog. If you have a post that's directly related to what someone is writing about, include a link to it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

I recommend Google Analytics because it provides whole-site metrics, in addition to page-by-page metrics. It's important to understand how visitors arrive at the site <em>as a whole</em>, because visitors can arrive at the same content in countless different ways.

<ul>
<li>Set up a <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> account and add the tracking code to your blog per the instructions.</li>
<li>Watch Traffic Sources &gt; Overview to see how traffic arrives at your blog.</li>
<li>Watch Traffic Sources &gt; Referring Sites to see which sites are sending traffic to your blog. Consider adding frequent referrers to your blogroll or list of links.</li>
<li>Watch Content &gt; Overview to see which posts are doing particularly well or poorly.</li>
<li>If you want to make the most of your blogging efforts, monthly metrics reports won't cut it. You'll need to be paying regular attention to analytics information -- especially to referring sites -- to pounce on opportunities and to put out fires.</li>
</ul>
